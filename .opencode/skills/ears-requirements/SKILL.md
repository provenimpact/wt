## What I do

Guide the writing, review, and translation of requirements using the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) methodology.

## Reference Material

The canonical EARS patterns, templates, examples, and checklists are in `references/ears-reference.adoc`. Consult it for sentence type definitions, templates, and troubleshooting. The content below provides operational guidance for applying the methodology — it does not duplicate the reference.

## How to Apply EARS

Follow these steps when writing or translating requirements:

1. **Identify** whether you are working with a requirement, or something else (e.g. a note, example, or design decision). Only requirements get EARS treatment.
2. **Identify compound requirements** -- determine whether the requirement needs to be split into multiple atomic requirements.
3. **Identify the acting system, person, or process.**
4. **Analyse the needed sentence type(s)** -- select from Ubiquitous, Event-driven, State-driven, Unwanted behavior, or Optional feature. Use Complex (combined) when you need both preconditions (Where/While) and a trigger (When), including within If-then statements for unwanted behavior. When combining keywords, use this order: **Where** ... **While** ... **When** ... / **If** ... **then** ...
5. **Identify possible missing requirements** -- e.g. 2 states and 2 events usually produce 4 requirements. Check all combinations.
6. **Analyse the translated requirements** for ambiguity, conflict, and repetition.
7. **Review requirements** if possible. Iterate as required.

## Checking for Completeness

After writing requirements, use the following techniques to find gaps.

### Truth Tables

When a system function operates across multiple states or modes, build a truth table listing every combination. Each cell represents a potential requirement. Missing cells often reveal missing requirements.

### Function-Level Review

For each identified system function, ask:

1. Is there a requirement for normal operation? (Typically ubiquitous.)
2. Does the function have accuracy, timing, or sequencing constraints?
3. Under what conditions does it activate? (Event-driven or state-driven.)
4. Are there availability or reliability requirements?
5. What should happen on failure or invalid input? (Unwanted behavior.)

### Requirement Pairing

Requirements often come in natural pairs. When you write one side, check the counterpart:

- **Wanted / Unwanted:** Normal behavior paired with error handling.
- **Primary / Backup:** Main operating mode paired with fallback mode.
- **Enable / Disable:** Activating a feature paired with deactivating it.
- **Start / Stop:** Initiating a process paired with terminating it.

### Traceability Through Structure

Each clause in a combined EARS requirement (Where, While, When) implies a sub-function that may need its own lower-level requirement. Use the structure of combined requirements as a traceability aid.

## Choosing a Pattern

    REQ["Requirement"] --> Q1{"Always true?<br/>(no trigger,<br/>no condition)"}

    Q1 -->|Yes| UBIQ["Ubiquitous<br/>'The system shall...'"]
    Q1 -->|No| Q2{"Triggered by<br/>an event?"}

    Q2 -->|Yes| Q2b{"Also needs<br/>preconditions?"}
    Q2 -->|No| Q3{"Depends on<br/>a state/mode?"}

    Q2b -->|Yes| COMPLEX["Complex<br/>'Where... While... When...'"]
    Q2b -->|No| EVENT["Event-driven<br/>'When &lt;event&gt;,<br/>the system shall...'"]

    Q3 -->|Yes| STATE["State-driven<br/>'While &lt;state&gt;,<br/>the system shall...'"]
    Q3 -->|No| Q4{"Feature-<br/>dependent?"}

    Q4 -->|Yes| OPTIONAL["Optional feature<br/>'Where &lt;feature enabled&gt;,<br/>the system shall...'"]
    Q4 -->|No| Q5{"Error / failure<br/>handling?"}

    Q5 -->|Yes| UNWANTED["Unwanted behavior<br/>'If &lt;condition&gt;,<br/>then the system shall...'"]
    Q5 -->|No| UBIQ
```

- Always true -> Ubiquitous
- Triggered by an event -> Event-driven
- Depends on a state/mode -> State-driven
- Depends on a feature -> Optional feature
- Error/invalid/failure handling -> Unwanted behavior
- Needs both preconditions and a trigger -> Complex

### Ubiquitous vs. Event-Driven

When a behavior could be either ubiquitous or event-driven, consider the system's criticality and operational context. A monitoring system that must always show the latest value needs ubiquitous (continuous). A notification system that only acts on change needs event-driven. If unclear, ask the stakeholder.

### Passive vs. Active Response

Some requirements demand tolerance without active response (passive), others require detection and action (active):

- **Passive:** The system shall be immune to `<condition>`.
- **Active:** When `<condition is detected>`, the system shall `<response>`.

## Characteristics of a Good Requirement

Every requirement you write or review must satisfy all of these:

| Characteristic | Description |
|---|---|
| **Unambiguous** | Has only one interpretation |
| **Traceable** | Has a unique identifier |
| **Consistent** | Does not conflict with other requirements |
| **Verifiable** | It is possible to check that the system meets the requirement |
| **Complete** | Not lacking relevant information |
| **Atomic** | Expresses a single behavior; not a compound statement |
| **Implementation-free** | States *what* the system does, not *how* it is built |
| **Concise** | Uses no more words than necessary to convey the meaning |
| **Non-duplicated** | Does not restate the same intent as another requirement |
