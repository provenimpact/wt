description: Assess and remediate the project security posture. Use when the proven-intent orchestrator determines that security improvements are needed. Operates at the project level. Observes dependency vulnerabilities, code patterns (hardcoded secrets, injection risks, insecure defaults), and configuration issues. Proposes and applies remediations that satisfy security constraints.
---

## Prerequisites

This skill is invoked by the `proven-intent` orchestrator, which provides the desired state and current state context.

## Observe

Assess the current security posture of the project.

### 1. Dependency vulnerabilities

Run the appropriate audit tool for the project's package manager:
- `npm audit` / `yarn audit` / `pnpm audit`
- `cargo audit`
- `pip-audit`
- `bundle-audit`

Collect all known CVEs with severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

### 2. Code pattern analysis

Scan the codebase for common security anti-patterns:

| Pattern | Risk | Detection |
|---|---|---|
| Hardcoded secrets | High | API keys, passwords, tokens in source files |
| SQL injection | High | String concatenation in queries |
| Insecure deserialization | High | Unvalidated deserialization of external data |
| Missing input validation | Medium | User inputs passed directly to business logic |
| Insecure defaults | Medium | Default passwords, debug modes in production config |
| Missing authentication | Medium | Endpoints without auth checks |
| Sensitive data in logs | Medium | PII or credentials logged |
| Insecure crypto | Medium | Weak algorithms (MD5, SHA1 for security), small key sizes |

### 3. Configuration review

Check for security-relevant configuration issues:
- CORS settings
- HTTPS enforcement
- Cookie security flags (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- Rate limiting configuration
- Authentication/authorization configuration

### 4. Read constraints

Read `constraints.adoc` from the project root. Identify all security constraints.

### 5. Report observation

Return to the orchestrator:
```
Security posture:
  dependency-vulnerabilities: {critical: N, high: N, medium: N, low: N}
  code-patterns: [{pattern, severity, file, line}]
  configuration-issues: [{issue, severity}]
  constraint-violations: [list]
```

## Evaluate

Given the desired state from the orchestrator, determine what action is needed.

### 1. Map desired state to actions

| Desired State | Actions |
|---|---|
| "No known vulnerabilities" | Patch dependencies (delegate to `needs-dependencies`), remediate code patterns |
| "No hardcoded secrets" | Move secrets to environment variables or secret management |
| "All user input validated" | Add validation layers where missing |
| "Security best practices" | Address all findings by severity (Critical first) |

### 2. Prioritize by severity

1. Critical vulnerabilities and hardcoded secrets → immediate action
2. High severity findings → action required
3. Medium severity → recommended action
4. Low severity → advisory

### 3. Check constraint implications

- Which constraint violations would be resolved?
- Would any remediation introduce new issues (e.g., breaking API compatibility)?

### 4. Report evaluation

Return to the orchestrator:
```
Action: remediate / audit-only / none
Findings by severity: {critical: N, high: N, medium: N, low: N}
Proposed remediations: [{finding, remediation, risk, files-affected}]
Dependency actions: [delegate to needs-dependencies]
```

```

### 1. Dependency remediations

For dependency vulnerabilities, delegate to the `needs-dependencies` capability via the orchestrator. This skill focuses on code and configuration remediations.

### 2. Code remediations

For each approved remediation:
1. Apply the fix (move secrets, add validation, fix injection, etc.)
2. Verify the fix doesn't break existing functionality

### 3. Configuration remediations

For each configuration issue:
1. Apply the secure configuration
2. Document the change

### 4. Verify

After all remediations:
1. Re-run security scans to confirm findings are resolved
2. Run the build and test suite to confirm nothing is broken
3. Verify all security constraints are satisfied

### 5. Report results

Return to the orchestrator:
```
Remediations applied: [{finding, fix, status}]
Verification: {security-scan: pass/fail, build: pass/fail, tests: pass/fail}
Constraint violations resolved: [list]
Remaining findings: [list or none]
```
