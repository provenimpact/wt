## Development Workflow
This project uses the proven-needs state transition workflow.
To make changes, declare a desired state and the system will derive
the minimal valid transition: Observe → Evaluate → Derive → Execute → Validate.
Feature work is organized in `docs/features/`. Project constraints are in `constraints.adoc`.
Load the `proven-needs` skill to start.
