= ADR-0001: Use Go for the CLI
:status: Accepted
:date: 2026-02-24
:deciders: Project team

== Context

The `wt` tool is a command-line utility for managing git worktrees. It needs to be distributed as a single binary with no runtime dependencies, start instantly, and run on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

== Decision

Use Go as the implementation language.

== Consequences

* Single static binary with no runtime dependency simplifies installation (`go install` or download).
* Fast startup time (sub-10ms) -- important for an interactive CLI tool invoked frequently.
* Excellent cross-compilation support for all target platforms.
* Rich ecosystem of CLI libraries (cobra, bubbletea).
* Team must be comfortable with Go. No generics-heavy abstractions needed for this project scope.

== Alternatives Considered

=== Rust
Strong candidate. Equivalent single-binary story, better performance characteristics, strong type system. Rejected due to longer compile times during development and less mature TUI library ecosystem compared to Go's Charm libraries. Would be a valid choice.

=== TypeScript (Node.js / Bun)
Fast development velocity but requires a runtime to be installed. Distribution is more complex (npm global install or bundled binary via pkg/bun compile). Rejected due to runtime dependency requirement.

=== Shell script (bash)
Zero compilation, portable on Unix. Rejected because implementing a TUI fuzzy selector in pure bash is fragile, and cross-platform support (fish, Windows) would be very difficult.
