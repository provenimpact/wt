= ADR-0002: Use cobra for CLI framework
:status: Accepted
:date: 2026-02-24
:deciders: Project team

== Context

The `wt` tool needs a subcommand structure (`wt create`, `wt remove`, `wt list`, etc.) with flags, argument validation, and auto-generated help text.

== Decision

Use the `spf13/cobra` library for CLI command parsing and routing.

== Consequences

* Well-established standard for Go CLIs (used by kubectl, docker, hugo, gh).
* Built-in subcommand support, flag parsing, argument validation, and shell completion generation.
* Adds one dependency but it is stable and widely maintained.
* Help text and usage messages are auto-generated, reducing boilerplate.

== Alternatives Considered

=== urfave/cli
Another popular Go CLI library. Comparable features. Rejected due to less ecosystem familiarity and slightly less ergonomic subcommand API for this use case.

=== Standard library (flag package)
No dependency added. Rejected because implementing subcommand routing, help generation, and argument validation manually adds significant boilerplate without benefit.
