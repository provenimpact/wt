== TRANSITION-002
:date: 2026-02-24
:intent: Complete missing workflow capabilities: tests, architecture, ADRs, and design reconciliation
:type: Artifact maintenance
:risk: Medium
:features: worktree-management (maintained)
:desired-state: Full test coverage for all 28 spec requirements, architecture document reflecting the system, ADRs recording all technology decisions, design reconciled with implementation
:prior-state: Feature implemented but missing: tests (0 test files), architecture doc, ADRs, design had 3 minor divergences from implementation
:capabilities-invoked: needs-tests, needs-architecture, needs-adr, needs-implementation (divergence detection and design reconciliation)
:constraints-checked: n/a (no constraints defined)
:result: Achieved
:artifacts-modified: internal/tui/selector_test.go (new), internal/shell/shell_test.go (new), internal/git/git_test.go (new), internal/repo/repo_test.go (new), cmd/cmd_test.go (new), docs/architecture.adoc (v1.0.0, new), docs/adrs/index.adoc (v1.0.0, new), docs/adrs/0001-use-go.adoc (new), docs/adrs/0002-use-cobra-for-cli.adoc (new), docs/adrs/0003-use-bubbletea-for-tui.adoc (new), docs/adrs/0004-shell-out-to-git.adoc (new), docs/features/worktree-management/design.adoc (v1.0.0 -> v1.0.1, reconciled)

== TRANSITION-001
:date: 2026-02-24
:intent: A CLI tool that makes it easy to create, manage, remove, and switch between git worktrees using a TUI fuzzy selector and a sibling worktrees directory convention
:type: Feature evolution
:risk: High
:features: worktree-management (new)
:desired-state: The wt CLI binary exists with create, remove, list, switch, status, and init commands. Interactive fuzzy selector on bare invocation. Worktrees stored in <repo>-worktrees/ sibling directory. Shell integration for cd via wt init.
:prior-state: Empty repository with project scaffolding only
:capabilities-invoked: needs-stories, needs-spec, needs-design, needs-tasks, needs-implementation
:constraints-checked: n/a (no constraints defined)
:result: Achieved
:artifacts-modified: docs/features/worktree-management/user-stories.adoc (v1.0.0), docs/features/worktree-management/spec.adoc (v1.0.0), docs/features/worktree-management/design.adoc (v1.0.0), docs/features/worktree-management/tasks.adoc (v1.0.0 -> Implemented), AGENTS.md, .gitignore, main.go, go.mod, go.sum, cmd/root.go, cmd/create.go, cmd/remove.go, cmd/list.go, cmd/switch.go, cmd/status.go, cmd/init.go, internal/repo/repo.go, internal/git/git.go, internal/tui/selector.go, internal/shell/shell.go
